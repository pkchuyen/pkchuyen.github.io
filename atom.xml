    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The fallacies</h3>


<p>The fallacies are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
1. The network is reliable.<br>
2. Latency is zero.<br>
3. Bandwidth is infinite.<br>
4. The network is secure.<br>
5. Topology doesn&#8217;t change.<br>
6. There is one administrator.<br>
7. Transport cost is zero.<br>
8. The network is homogeneous.<br>
</ul>




<h3>Effects of the fallacies</h3>


<ol>
<li><p>Ignorance of network latency, and of the packet loss it can cause, induces application- and transport-layer developers to allow unbounded traffic, greatly increasing dropped packets and wasting bandwidth.</p></li>
<li><p>Complacency regarding network security results in being blindsided by malicious users and programs that continually adapt to security measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple administrators, as with subnets for rival companies, may institute conflicting policies of which senders of network traffic must be aware in order to complete their desired paths.</p></li>
<li><p>The &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs of building and maintaining a network or subnet are non-negligible and must consequently be noted in budgets to avoid vast shortfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignorance of bandwidth limits on the part of traffic senders can result in bottlenecks over frequency-multiplexed media.</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is my &ldquo;First Post&rdquo; since i start using Octopress as a new blogging platform. Wordpress has been used for my first Blog and it was great but Octopress make me impressive as it is a blogging platform which work good on terminal and different with others.</p>

<p>I have used Wordpress for a long time to take note and share my working experiences (also give an idea to discuss with my friend and my colleagues) for a long time but now i decide to use Octopress instead. It is awesome and a good idea so far.</p>

<p>Besides, i would like to dig deeper into Ruby world which puppet written on. Working as a system engineer and i use puppet to do automation tasks so more knowledge in ruby programming will help my career a lot.</p>

<p>Guys, hope you can find out a helpful info on my posts.<br>
And don&rsquo;t hesitate to ping me if needs to support on something. My door is always opened :)</p>
