    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is my First Post.
This is my first post since i start using Octopress as a blogging platform. i have used Wordpress, it is great but Octopress make me impressive as it is a blogging platform which work good on terminal and different with others.</p>

<p>I have used Wordpress for a long time to take note and share my working experiences (also give an idea to discuss with my friend and my colleagues) for a long time but now i decide to use Octopress instead. It is awesome and a good idea so far.</p>

<p>Besides, i would like to dig deeper into Ruby world which puppet written on. Working as a system engineer and i use puppet to do automation tasks so more knowledge in ruby programming will help my career a lot.</p>

<p>Guys, hope you can find out a helpful info on my posts.<br>
And don&rsquo;t hesitate to ping me if needs to support on something. My door is always opened :)</p>
