    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The fallacies</h3>


<p>The fallacies are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
1. The network is reliable.<br>
2. Latency is zero.<br>
3. Bandwidth is infinite.<br>
4. The network is secure.<br>
5. Topology doesn&#8217;t change.<br>
6. There is one administrator.<br>
7. Transport cost is zero.<br>
8. The network is homogeneous.<br>
</ul>




<h3>Effects of the fallacies</h3>


<ol>
<li><p>Ignorance of network latency, and of the packet loss it can cause, induces application- and transport-layer developers to allow unbounded traffic, greatly increasing dropped packets and wasting bandwidth.</p></li>
<li><p>Complacency regarding network security results in being blindsided by malicious users and programs that continually adapt to security measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple administrators, as with subnets for rival companies, may institute conflicting policies of which senders of network traffic must be aware in order to complete their desired paths.</p></li>
<li><p>The &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs of building and maintaining a network or subnet are non-negligible and must consequently be noted in budgets to avoid vast shortfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignorance of bandwidth limits on the part of traffic senders can result in bottlenecks over frequency-multiplexed media.</p></li>
</ol>
